An app for assetto corsa to show a warning when traffic is slowing down in front of you by Halvhjearne

http://www.twitch.tv/halvhjearne

this is a free app and may not be used in any commercial way without written permission from Halvhjearne.

To install click the green code icon and press dowload zip, open the zip file and find the apps folder, now drop that into your assetto corsa root folder and you are done.

when ingame its a good idea to enable the "show warning" option untill you have set the size of the warning and placed it in a good position on the screen, then disable it.

Known problems: 

warning may flicker sometimes
